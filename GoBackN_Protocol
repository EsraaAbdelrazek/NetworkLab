Sender Class (Sender):

    Responsibility: Simulates the behavior of the sender node in the Go-Back-N protocol.
    Variables:
        windowSize: Represents the size of the sender's window for sending packets.
        base: Indicates the sequence number of the oldest unacknowledged packet.
        nextSeqNum: Tracks the sequence number of the next packet to be sent.
        totalPackets: Represents the total number of packets to be sent.
        acks: An array to store acknowledgment statuses for packets.

Sender Methods:

    send(): Implements the sender's logic for sending packets and handling acknowledgments.
    Logic:
        The sender sends packets in a loop until all packets are acknowledged.
        It maintains a sending window based on the windowSize.
        Checks for acknowledgments and retransmits packets on timeout events.
        Simulates ACK reception and packet retransmission based on Go-Back-N behavior.

Receiver Class (Receiver):

    Responsibility: Simulates the behavior of the receiver node in the Go-Back-N protocol.
    Variables:
        base: Represents the sequence number of the oldest packet expected by the receiver.
        totalPackets: Indicates the total number of packets to be received.
        recvd: An array to track received packets.

Receiver Method:

    receive(): Implements the receiver's logic for receiving packets and sending acknowledgments.
    Logic:
        Simulates the reception of packets and sends acknowledgments.
        Handles the expected sequence number and ACK generation based on received packets.

main() Function:

    Initializes the sender and receiver objects.
    Executes the simulation by calling the send() and receive() methods.
    Simulates the interaction between sender and receiver, displaying messages for packet transmission, reception, timeouts, and acknowledgments.

Simulation Flow:

    The sender generates packets, simulates transmissions, and handles timeouts or lost acknowledgments.
    The receiver receives packets, generates acknowledgments, and handles out-of-sequence packets.
    The simulation displays messages to depict the exchange of packets and acknowledgments between sender and receiver.

This code is a simplified simulation to illustrate the Go-Back-N protocol's basic functioning without actual network communication. It's designed to demonstrate the sender's and receiver's behaviors in handling packets and acknowledgments within a simulated environment.
